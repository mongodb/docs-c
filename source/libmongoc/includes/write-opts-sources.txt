Use this function for commands that write such as "drop" or "createRole" (but not for "insert",
"update", or "delete", see :ref:`basic-write-ops`). Write concern and collation can be overridden
by various sources. In a transaction, read concern and write concern are prohibited in ``opts``.
The highest-priority sources for these options are listed first in the following table. The write
concern is omitted for MongoDB before 3.4.

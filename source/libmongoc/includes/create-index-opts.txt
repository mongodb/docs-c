``command_opts`` may be NULL or a BSON document with additional command options:

* ``writeConcern``: Construct a :ref:`mongoc_write_concern_t` and use :ref:`mongoc_write_concern_append` to add the write concern to ``opts``. See the example code for :ref:`mongoc_client_write_command_with_opts`.
* ``sessionId``: First, construct a :ref:`mongoc_client_session_t` with :ref:`mongoc_client_start_session`. You can begin a transaction with :ref:`mongoc_client_session_start_transaction`, optionally with a :ref:`mongoc_transaction_opt_t` that overrides the options inherited from |opts-source|, and use :ref:`mongoc_client_session_append` to add the session to ``opts``. See the example code for :ref:`mongoc_client_session_t`.

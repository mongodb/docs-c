Deprecated feature: automatic initialization and cleanup
--------------------------------------------------------

On some platforms the driver can automatically call :ref:`mongoc_init` before ``main``,
and call :ref:`mongoc_cleanup` as the process exits. This is problematic in situations where related
libraries also execute cleanup code on shutdown, and it creates inconsistent rules across platforms.
Therefore the automatic initialization and cleanup feature is deprecated, and will be dropped in
version 2.0. Meanwhile, for backward compatibility, the feature is *enabled* by default on platforms
where it is available.

For portable, future-proof code, always call :ref:`mongoc_init` and :ref:`mongoc_cleanup` yourself,
and configure the driver like:

.. code-block:: none

   cmake -DENABLE_AUTOMATIC_INIT_AND_CLEANUP=OFF

``opts`` may be NULL or a BSON document with additional command options:

* ``readConcern``: Construct a :ref:`mongoc_read_concern_t` and use :ref:`mongoc_read_concern_append` to add the read concern to ``opts``. See the example code for :ref:`mongoc_client_read_command_with_opts`. Read concern requires MongoDB 3.2 or later, otherwise an error is returned.
* ``writeConcern``: Construct a :ref:`mongoc_write_concern_t` and use :ref:`mongoc_write_concern_append` to add the write concern to ``opts``. See the example code for :ref:`mongoc_client_write_command_with_opts`.
* ``sessionId``: First, construct a :ref:`mongoc_client_session_t` with :ref:`mongoc_client_start_session`. You can begin a transaction with :ref:`mongoc_client_session_start_transaction`, optionally with a :ref:`mongoc_transaction_opt_t` that overrides the options inherited from |opts-source|, and use :ref:`mongoc_client_session_append` to add the session to ``opts``. See the example code for :ref:`mongoc_client_session_t`.
* ``bypassDocumentValidation``: Set to ``true`` to skip server-side schema validation of the provided BSON documents.
* ``collation``: Configure textual comparisons. See :ref:`Setting Collation Order <setting_collation_order>`, and `the MongoDB Manual entry on Collation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/collation/>`_. Collation requires MongoDB 3.2 or later, otherwise an error is returned.
* ``serverId``: To target a specific server, include an int32 "serverId" field. Obtain the id by calling :ref:`mongoc_client_select_server`, then :ref:`mongoc_server_description_id` on its return value.
* ``batchSize``: An ``int32`` representing number of documents requested to be returned on each call to :ref:`mongoc_cursor_next`
* ``let``: A BSON document consisting of any number of parameter names, each followed by definitions of constants in the MQL Aggregate Expression language.
* ``comment``: A :ref:`bson_value_t` specifying the comment to attach to this command. The comment will appear in log messages, profiler output, and currentOp output. Only string values are supported prior to MongoDB 4.4.
* ``hint``: A document or string that specifies the index to use to support the query predicate.

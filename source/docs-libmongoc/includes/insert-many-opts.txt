``opts`` may be NULL or a BSON document with additional command options:

* ``writeConcern``: Construct a :ref:`mongoc_write_concern_t` and use :ref:`mongoc_write_concern_append` to add the write concern to ``opts``. See the example code for :ref:`mongoc_client_write_command_with_opts`.
* ``sessionId``: First, construct a :ref:`mongoc_client_session_t` with :ref:`mongoc_client_start_session`. You can begin a transaction with :ref:`mongoc_client_session_start_transaction`, optionally with a :ref:`mongoc_transaction_opt_t` that overrides the options inherited from |opts-source|, and use :ref:`mongoc_client_session_append` to add the session to ``opts``. See the example code for :ref:`mongoc_client_session_t`.
* ``validate``: Construct a bitwise-or of all desired :ref:`bson_validate_flags_t <bson_validate_with_error>`. Set to ``false`` to skip client-side validation of the provided BSON documents.
* ``comment``: A :ref:`bson_value_t` specifying the comment to attach to this command. The comment will appear in log messages, profiler output, and currentOp output. Requires MongoDB 4.4 or later.
* ``ordered``: set to ``false`` to attempt to insert all documents, continuing after errors.
* ``bypassDocumentValidation``: Set to ``true`` to skip server-side schema validation of the provided BSON documents.

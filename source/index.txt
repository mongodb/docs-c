Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB C driver.
You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB in C.
Download the required libraries, ``libmongoc`` and ``libbson``, by following
the :ref:`obtaining_libraries` instructions or set up a runnable project by
following our tutorial.

- :ref:`Tutorial <mongoc_tutorial>`

Get Started
-----------

Learn how to install the driver, establish a connection to MongoDB, and begin
working with data in the :ref:`c-get-started` tutorial.

Connect to MongoDB
------------------

in the :ref:`c-connect` section.

Databases and Collections
-------------------------
Learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to work with MongoDB databases and collections in the
:ref:`c-databases-collections` section.

Write Data to MongoDB
---------------------

Learn how you can write data to MongoDB in the :ref:`c-write` section.

Read Data from MongoDB
----------------------

Learn how you can retrieve data from MongoDB in the :ref:`c-read` section.

Optimize Queries by Using Indexes
---------------------------------

Learn how to work with common types of indexes in the :ref:`c-indexes`

Install From Source
-------------------

Learn how to build the ``libmongoc`` and ``libbson`` libraries from their source
code in the :ref:`c-install-from-source` section.

Configure Operations on Replica Sets
------------------------------------

Learn how to configure read and write operations on a replica set in the
:ref:`c-read-write-config` section.

If you are using a version of MongoDB or the driver that lacks support for the
Stable API, you can use the following code snippet to test your connection
to your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/c-connection-no-stable-api.c
   :language: c

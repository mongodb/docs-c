Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the :wikipedia:`TLS <Transport_Layer_Security>`
protocol to secure your connection to a MongoDB deployment.

When you enable TLS for a connection, {+driver-short+} performs the following actions:

- Uses TLS to connect to the MongoDB deployment
- Verifies the deployment's certificate
- Ensures that the certificate certifies the deployment

To learn how to configure your MongoDB deployment for TLS, see the
:manual:`TLS configuration guide </tutorial/configure-ssl/>` in the
MongoDB Server manual. 

.. important::

   A full description of TLS/SSL, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) certificates, and
   Certificate Authorities (CAs) is beyond the scope of this document. This page assumes prior
   knowledge of TLS/SSL and access to valid certificates.

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the :wikipedia:`TLS <Transport_Layer_Security>`
protocol to secure your connection to a MongoDB deployment.

When you enable TLS for a connection, the {+driver-short+} performs the following actions:

- Uses TLS to connect to the MongoDB deployment
- Verifies the deployment's certificate
- Ensures that the certificate certifies the deployment

To learn how to configure your MongoDB deployment for TLS, see the
:manual:`TLS configuration guide </tutorial/configure-ssl/>` in the
MongoDB Server manual. 

.. important::

   A full description of TLS/SSL, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) certificates, and
   Certificate Authorities (CAs) is beyond the scope of this document. This page assumes prior
   knowledge of TLS/SSL and access to valid certificates.

.. _c-enable-tls:

Enable TLS
----------

You can enable TLS on a connection to your MongoDB instance
in the following ways:

- Setting the ``tls`` parameter in your connection string
- Using the ``mongoc_uri_set_option_as_bool()`` function to set the ``MONGOC_URI_TLS`` connection
  option to ``true``

         :dedent:

.. tip::
   
   If your connection string includes the ``+srv`` modification, which specifies the
   SRV connection format, TLS is enabled on your connection by default.

   To learn more about the SRV connection format, see
   :manual:`SRV Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format>`
   in the {+mdb-server+} documentation.

.. _c-specify-ca-file:

Specify a CA File
------------------



When MongoDB is started with TLS enabled, it will by default require the client to provide
a client certificate issued by a certificate authority specified by `--tlsCAFile`, or an authority
trusted by the native certificate store in use on the server.

To provide the client certificate, set the `tlsCertificateKeyFile` in the URI to a PEM armored
certificate file:

.. code-block:: c

   mongoc_uri_t *uri = mongoc_uri_new ("mongodb://localhost:27017/");
   mongoc_uri_set_option_as_bool (uri, MONGOC_URI_TLS, true);
   mongoc_uri_set_option_as_utf8 (uri, MONGOC_URI_TLSCERTIFICATEKEYFILE, "/path/to/client-certificate.pem");

   mongoc_client_t *client = mongoc_client_new_from_uri (uri);

.. TODO, if decide to make all these code examples more comprehensive
.. then make this an include rather than an inline code-block

.. _c-certificate-revocation:

Server Certificate Verification
-------------------------------

The MongoDB C Driver will automatically verify the validity of the server certificate, such as issued
by configured Certificate Authority, hostname validation, and expiration.

To overwrite this behavior, it is possible to disable hostname validation, OCSP endpoint revocation checking,
revocation checking entirely, and allow invalid certificates.

This behavior is controlled using the ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames``, ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck``,
``tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck``, and ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` options. By default,
all are set to ``false``.

It is not recommended to change these defaults as it exposes the client to *Man In The Middle* attacks (when
``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` is set), invalid certificates (when ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` is set), or
potentially revoked certificates (when ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` or ``tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck``
are set).

Supported Libraries
-------------------

By default, libmongoc will attempt to find a supported TLS library and enable TLS support. This is controlled
by the cmake flag ``ENABLE_SSL``, which is set to ``AUTO`` by default. Valid values are:

- ``AUTO`` the default behavior. Link to the system's native TLS library, or attempt to find OpenSSL.
- ``DARWIN`` link to Secure Transport, the native TLS library on macOS.
- ``WINDOWS`` link to Secure Channel, the native TLS library on Windows.
- ``OPENSSL`` link to OpenSSL (libssl). An optional install path may be specified with ``OPENSSL_ROOT``.
- ``LIBRESSL`` link to LibreSSL's libtls. (LibreSSL's compatible libssl may be linked to by setting ``OPENSSL``).
- ``OFF`` disable TLS support.

OpenSSL
~~~~~~~

The MongoDB C Driver uses OpenSSL on Linux and Unix platforms (besides macOS). Industry best practices
and some regulations require the use of TLS 1.1 or newer, which requires at least OpenSSL 1.0.1. Use the following command
to check your OpenSSL version:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ openssl version

Ensure your system's OpenSSL is a recent version (at least 1.0.1), or use the following command to install a recent version in a
non-system path and build against it:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/absolute/path/to/openssl

When compiled against OpenSSL, the driver will attempt to load the system default certificate store, as configured by the
distribution. That can be overridden by setting the ``tlsCAFile`` URI option or with the fields ``ca_file`` and ``ca_dir``
in the `mongoc_ssl_opt_t <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_ssl_opt_t.html>`__.

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) (see `RFC 6960 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960>`__) is fully supported
when using OpenSSL 1.0.1+ with the following notes:

- When a ``crl_file`` is set with `mongoc_ssl_opt_t <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_ssl_opt_t.html>`__ and the ``crl_file`` revokes
  the server's certificate, the certificate is considered revoked (even if the certificate has a valid stapled OCSP response).

LibreSSL / libtls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB C Driver supports LibreSSL through the use of OpenSSL compatibility checks when configured to compile against
``openssl``. It also supports the new ``libtls`` library when configured to build against ``libressl``.

When compiled against the Windows native libraries, the ``crl_file`` option of a `mongoc_ssl_opt_t <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_ssl_opt_t.html>`__ is not supported,
and will issue an error if used.

Setting ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` and ``tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck`` has no effect.

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) (see `RFC 6960 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960>`__) is partially supported
with the following notes:

- The Must-Staple extension (see `RFC 7633 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7633>`__) is ignored.
- Connection will continue if a Must-Staple certificate is presented without a stapled response and the OCSP responder is down.
- Connection will not continue if the client receives a revoked response from an OCSP responder.

Native TLS Support on Windows (Secure Channel)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB C Driver supports the Windows native TLS library (Secure Channel, or SChannel) and its native crypto library
(Cryptography API: Next Generation, or CNG).

When compiled against the Windows native libraries, the ``ca_dir`` option of a `mongoc_ssl_opt_t <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_ssl_opt_t.html>`__ is not supported
and will issue an error if used.

Encrypted PEM files (e.g., setting ``tlsCertificateKeyPassword``) are also not supported and will result in error when
attempting to load them.

When ``tlsCAFile`` is set, the driver will only allow server certificates issued by the authority (or authorities) provided.
When no ``tlsCAFile`` is set, the driver will look up the Certificate Authority using the ``System Local Machine Root``
certificate store to confirm the provided certificate.

When ``crl_file`` is set with `mongoc_ssl_opt_t <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_ssl_opt_t.html>`__, the driver will import the revocation list to the
``System Local Machine Root`` certificate store.

Setting ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` has no effect.

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) (see `RFC 6960 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960>`__) is partially supported
with the following notes:

- The Must-Staple extension (see `RFC 7633 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7633>`__) is ignored.
- Connection will continue if a Must-Staple certificate is presented without a stapled response and the OCSP responder is down.
- Connection will not continue if the client receives a revoked response from an OCSP responder.
- When a ``crl_file`` is set with `mongoc_ssl_opt_t <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_ssl_opt_t.html>`__, and the ``crl_file`` revokes the server's certificate, the OCSP response
  takes precedence. For example, if the server presents a certificate with a valid stapled OCSP response, the certificate is considered
  valid even if the ``crl_file`` marks it as revoked.

.. _secure-transport:

Native TLS Support on macOS / Darwin (Secure Transport)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB C Driver supports the Darwin (OS X, macOS, iOS) native TLS library (Secure Transport), and its native crypto
library (Common Crypto, or CC).

When compiled against Secure Transport, the ``ca_dir`` and ``crl_file`` options of a `mongoc_ssl_opt_t <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_ssl_opt_t.html>`__ are not supported.
An error is issued if either are used.

When ``tlsCAFile`` is set, the driver will only allow server certificates issued by the authority (or authorities) provided.
When no ``tlsCAFile`` is set, the driver will use the Certificate Authorities in the unlocked keychains.

Setting ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` and ``tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck`` has no effect.

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) (see `RFC 6960 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960>`__) is partially supported
with the following notes.

- The Must-Staple extension (see `RFC 7633 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7633>`__) is ignored.
- Connection will continue if a Must-Staple certificate is presented without a stapled response and the OCSP responder is down.
- Connection will not continue if the client receives a revoked response from an OCSP responder.

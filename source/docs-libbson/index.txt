A Cross Platform BSON Library for C

Introduction
------------

libbson builds, parses, and iterates `BSON <http://bsonspec.org>`_ documents, the native data format of
MongoDB. It also converts BSON to and from JSON, and provides a platform compatibility layer for
`the MongoDB C Driver <https://www.mongoc.org/>`_.

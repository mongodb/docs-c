.. _bson_destroy_with_steal:

=========================
bson_destroy_with_steal()
=========================

Synopsis
--------

.. code-block:: c

  uint8_t *
  bson_destroy_with_steal (bson_t *bson, bool steal, uint32_t *length);

Parameters
----------

- ``bson``: A :ref:`bson_t`
- ``steal``: A bool indicating if the underlying buffer should be stolen.
- ``length``: A location for storing the resulting buffer length.

Description
-----------

The :ref:`bson_destroy_with_steal` function shall destroy a :ref:`bson_t` structure but return the underlying
buffer instead of freeing it. If steal is false, this is equivalent to calling bson_destroy(). It is a
programming error to call this function on a :ref:`bson_t` that is not a top-level :ref:`bson_t`, such as those
initialized with :ref:`bson_append_document_begin`, :ref:`bson_append_array_begin`, and :ref:`bson_writer_begin`.

Returns
-------

:ref:`bson_destroy_with_steal` shall return a buffer containing the contents of the :ref:`bson_t` if ``steal`` is
non-zero. This should be freed with :ref:`bson_free` when no longer in use. ``length`` will be set to the length of the
bson document if non-NULL.

.. seealso::

  | :ref:`bson_steal`, a higher-level function that efficiently transfers the contents of one :ref:`bson_t` to another.
